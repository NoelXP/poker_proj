Project to hold python poker project. Currently working on creating a shuffler to shuffle cards and hold onto those cards on a table or felt which would be the controller I guess.

Right now just creating a program that prints out a deck of cards. Want to dockerize that and eventually make terraform code to create a tiny server, download the container run and destroy.
